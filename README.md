## Welcome to TBC Chemical Engineering

Hi there! I'm currently working on providing worked examples' implementation of few Chemical Engineering textbooks in Python 2.7. The solutions will be available both in raw python file as well as Jupyter notebook formats. I'm planning to provide the solutions for unsolved problems. However, this step is for much later.

Hope the ChE student community benefits from this purpose!
